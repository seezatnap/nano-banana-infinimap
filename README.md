# Nano Banana Infinimap

An experimental AI-powered infinite map generator that creates seamless, neighbor-aware tiles on demand.

**⚠️ Experimental Software**: This project is an experimental demonstration of the Gemini Nano Banana model's potential and should be used at your own risk.

## TL;DR

This is an experiment I made to test Nano Banana's ability to consistently infill, plus how to handle minor differences in renders by blending outputs.
The solution I hit on was to break the image up into many tiles, of which a 3x3 grid of tiles can fit comfily into Gemini's input limits. I then radially blend the generations with the previous tiles (if one exists at that position) to handle minor differences.
You can use it to generate gigantic, continuous maps at a reasonable cost.

## Technical Notes

- **Infill Accuracy**: Uses a checkerboard background matte to improve Nano Banana's infilling behavior. Accuracy is ~75% - sometimes regeneration is needed for better alignment.
- **Generation Reliability**: Occasionally renders may fail or produce unexpected results. Clear, descriptive prompts generally yield better results.
- **Performance**: The 3×3 preview system helps avoid bad generations before committing changes, reducing waste and improving results.
- **Code Quality**: Recently refactored with modern React patterns, TypeScript, performance optimizations, and modular component architecture.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Yarn package manager
- Google Cloud Platform account with Gemini API access

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/seezatnap/nano-banana-infinimap.git
cd infinimap
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

4. Add your Gemini API key to `.env.local`:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

You can obtain a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

5. Start the development server:
```bash
yarn dev
```

6. Open http://localhost:3000/map in your browser

## Getting Started

1. **Navigate the Map**: 
   - Use mouse to pan and scroll wheel to zoom
   - Position information automatically updates in URL for easy sharing
   - Glass panel shows current coordinates and zoom level

2. **Generate Your First Tile**: 
   - App starts at maximum zoom level (level 8) - tiles are immediately interactive
   - Hover over empty areas to see tile highlights
   - Click any tile to open the interactive menu
   - Choose "Generate" (green + button) for empty tiles

3. **Advanced Generation**:
   - Enter descriptive prompts like "mystical forest clearing" or "ancient stone bridge"
   - Use the **3×3 Preview System**: See a full 3×3 grid before committing changes
   - **Selective Application**: Choose which tiles to apply from the preview
   - **Blending Modes**: Toggle between raw output and edge-blended results

4. **Manage Existing Tiles**:
   - Click existing tiles to access **Regenerate** (blue ↻ button) or **Delete** (orange D button)
   - Delete removes tiles instantly without confirmation
   - Regenerate opens the same preview system for existing content

5. **Canvas Management**:
   - **Canvas Menu**: Located in top-right corner (⚙️ icon)
   - **Reset Canvas**: Clears all tiles and data for a fresh start
   - **Refresh Page**: Reloads the application

6. **Tips for Best Results**:
   - Nano Banana works best with clear, descriptive prompts
   - Use the preview system to avoid bad blends
   - Regenerate tiles that don't match neighboring content
   - The system automatically handles edge continuity

## Development

```bash
yarn dev        # Start development server
```

### Utility Scripts

```bash
# Reset canvas (clear all tiles and data)
node scripts/reset-canvas.js

# Create default tile (if missing)
node scripts/create-default-tile.js
```
